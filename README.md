## Background 
Terminus Est is a ergo-inspired keyboard tuned to my developer workflow.
I've tended to cluster my actions around vim-inpsired keybindings with discrete "leader" keys, and started to wish that my leader keys were a bit easier to hit.

This project was frustratingly complicated, too expensive, and ultimately worse than my perfectly fine, working keyboards. But it's worth it to build something cool.

Thanks to @dededecline for the great advice and @kh3dron for making the plate look nice when I couldn't figure out the CAD stuff.

## Key Features
- Split design for comfortability.
- Thumb clustered "leader" keys.

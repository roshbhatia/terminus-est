## Background 
Terminus Est is a ergo-inspired keyboard tuned to my developer workflow.
I've tended to cluster my actions around vim-inpsired keybindings with discrete "leader" keys, and started to wish that my leader keys were a bit easier to hit.

It's 100% open source, so you can go build and/or modify it yourself!


## Key Features
- Split design for comfortability.
- Mirrored center column keys for ultimate flexibility.
- Thumb clustered "leader" keys.
- Additional `<Esc>` and `<Space>` placements for additional ease-of-use.
